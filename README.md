Medium MediaPortal Skin


This skin intends to be a fully flexible skin without the need for an editor. Every aspect should be controlled based on SkinSettings.



Design inspiration is Windows 8 modern style. It focuses on typography with the Segoe UI font.



The skin creation process is documented on the MP forum @ http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/threads/building-a-skin-from-scratch-a-tour.119644/
